# Infinite Package Manager

A package manager for code generation that allows you to utilize modular programming to mix and match elements from different code bases. Used as the backend for infinite games. 


#Features

- takes a list of directories and deploys common libraries
- libraries handle user login, leaderboard, and coin logic
- aggregates the data behind the git repos in these directories, sorts and shows it
- takes the deployed version of the apps and snapshots them, then makes a web page which shows links to all the working ones
